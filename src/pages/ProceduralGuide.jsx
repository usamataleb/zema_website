          <p>
            The Zanzibar Environmental Management Authority (ZEMA) was
            established under Section 14(1) of the Zanzibar Environmental
            Management Act No. 3 of 2015, as amended in 2023. The Authority
            serves as the principal Government Agency responsible for all
            environmental matters under the Act. It is mandated to coordinate,
            regulate, monitor, and oversee all aspects of environmental
            management across Zanzibar. The primary objective of establishing
            ZEMA is to ensure coherence, efficiency, and effectiveness in the
            enforcement and management of environmental issues throughout the
            islands.

          <p>
            This procedural guide provides a step-by-step framework for
            investors and project proponents to obtain the relevant
            environmental permit, whether it is an Environmental Impact
            Assessment (EIA) Certificate, Environmental Clearance Certificate,
            Direct Environmental Clearance Certificate, or an Environmental
            Audit Certificate. It also outlines the roles and responsibilities
            of the project proponent, selected environmental experts or firms,
            and ZEMA.

          <p>
            The Zanzibar Environmental Management Authority (ZEMA) plays a
            fundamental role in facilitating investment and development
            initiatives in Zanzibar by ensuring that all proposed projects
            comply with established environmental standards, regulations, and
            safeguards. As the primary environmental regulatory body, ZEMA is
            responsible for coordinating environmental and social assessments,
            as well as monitoring compliance to safeguard both the environment
            and local communities. Through the issuance of environmental
            clearances and ongoing compliance oversight, ZEMA supports
            sustainable investment and promotes responsible development across
            the islands.
