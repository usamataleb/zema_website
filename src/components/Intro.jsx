            The Zanzibar Environmental Management Authority (ZEMA) was
            established under Section 14(1) of the Zanzibar Environmental
            Management Act No. 3 of 2015, as amended in 2023. The Authority
            serves as the principal Government Agency responsible for all
            environmental matters under the Act. It is mandated to coordinate,
            regulate, monitor, and oversee all aspects of environmental
            management across Zanzibar. The primary objective of establishing
            ZEMA is to ensure coherence, efficiency, and effectiveness in the
            enforcement and management of environmental issues throughout the
            islands.{" "}
