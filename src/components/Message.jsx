                  On behalf of the Zanzibar Environmental Management Authority
                  (ZEMA), I am very much delighted to have this opportunity to
                  welcome you to our official website.
                </p>

                  This platform is designed to serve as a reliable source of
                  information on environmental management in Zanzibar. Through
                  it, you will gain access to key documents and resources,
                  including the Zanzibar Environmental Policy of 2013, the
                  Environmental Management Act of 2015, relevant Regulations,
                  guidelines, and other procedures that govern environmental
                  protection and sustainable development in Zanzibar.

                  provide to ensure environmental protection, compliance,
                  enforcement, and the promotion of harmony between development
                  activities and environmental sustainability.
